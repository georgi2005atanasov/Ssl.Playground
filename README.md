# 🔒 Secure Server Communication Demo

This project shows how to build a **simple and secure communication system** between a client and a server.  
It uses **SSL encryption** for secure transport and **ADO.NET** for database access.  

All messages are sent as **JSON** and are fully **encrypted** to protect sensitive data.
